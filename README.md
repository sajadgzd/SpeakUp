## Preview 
The majority of crimes committed in the United States are never reported to the police. Worse still, the crimes that are reported are usually never solved. In 2016 a miserable 42 percent of violent crime and an even more miserable 36 percent of property crime was reported to US authorities.

In fact over a 12-year period from 2004 and 2015 more than 250,000 hate crimes in the United States went by unreported, according to a federal report released in 2018. It [found that](https://www.chicagotribune.com/nation-world/ct-hate-crimes-unreported-20170628-story.html) between 2011 and 2015 alone, 54% of violent hate crimes were not reported.
The report claimed that many victims fail to report such crimes for both personal and institutional reasons, with some immigrants reluctant to get the police involved for fear of deportation.For others, it is fear of losing a job, oneâ€™s family or simply distrust of the police that deters them from prosecuting.

According to National Crime Victimization Survey 2010-2016, the Majority of Sexual Assaults Are Not Reported to the Police. Only 230 out of every 1,000 sexual assaults are reported to police. That means about 3 out of 4 go unreported.
